    "## Arrays\n",
    "While the collections we have learned about are useful, they are not made for serious computational purposes. We want structures that are made to perform the numerical computations we need to analyze data and model systems. For this, we need to introduce the concept of arrays and the module `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`numpy` is an essential library for these computations. `numpy` is structured around its main datatype known as an array. If you know matrix algebra, you can think of 1-dimensional arrays as vectors and 2-dimensional arrays  as matrices. \n",

    "### One-dimensional arrays (vectors)\n",
    "First, we will discuss one-dimensional array, also known as vectors. In some ways, a one-dimensional array is like a list of numbers and like a list, it has a size.
